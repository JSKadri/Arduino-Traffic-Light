# Arduino-Traffic-Light
NET3001 Real-Time Systems Final Project

In my final project for my real-time systems course (NET 3001) at Carleton University, I created a traffic light system using the Arduino Board as a realtime system. Please note, we where not allowed to use any predefined Arduino based functions, we where to create our own or use what was provided in the course. Checkout the 5_TF-Enhanced - W22.pdf for more information about the project!
